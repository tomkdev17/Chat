Thanks for checking out my Chat project! 

At this point in my career I've done a few projects using React, however this is my very first project using React Native. It's been fun exploring the differences between React and it's Native counterpart. 

The project is setup to be used with Expo Go for testing, which means that you can download the Expo Go app on your mobile and see the app as you're working on it in real time which I think is pretty neat.
